Deck House, Inc. v. New Jersey State Bd. of Architects, 531 F. Supp. 633, 1982 U.S. Dist.

All that was required of School District 1 was to submit \"written notification\" to the DOF within thirty days, which it did. The mere fact that the petition was addressed to the Commissioner of Education and only was copied to the DOF (all within thirty days) did not provide a basis for granting the motion to dismiss filed by School District 2 particularly when the allocation of residential property (school) taxes are at issue.

AGEN LEXIS 411, Initial Decision, June 17, 2014.ALJ correctly reasoned that it could not compel the joinder of a utility company with a condominium association in an existing administrative proceeding challenging charges during a certain usage period under N.J.A.C. 1:1-1.3(a) because the Uniform Administrative Procedural Rules contained no procedural rule providing for the joinder of third parties.

Petitioner was properly notified of the settlement conference, served with the Initial Decision and given ample opportunity to respond to the adverse ruling, but chose not to. Turner v.

New Jersey State Bd. of Architects, 531 F. Supp. 633, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10633 (1982).Request for an independent evaluation by the parents of a child who was entitled to special education services was properly denied because the parents failed to appear at the hearing and thus offered no evidence countering that of the school board, offered ex parte as permitted by governing rules, to the effect that the evaluation completed by the school was appropriate.
